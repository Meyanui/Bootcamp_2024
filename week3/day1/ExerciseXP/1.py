# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs The Song Producer?
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example: stairway= Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])

class Song:
    def __init__(self, lyrics):
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    def sing_me_a_song(self):

            print(line)

our_song = [
    "There‚Äôs a lady who's sure", 
    "all that glitters is gold",

#To create object of the song class
new_song = Song(our_song)

 #to call the class
