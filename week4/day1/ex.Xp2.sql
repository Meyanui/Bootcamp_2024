--Bootcamp
--Create a database called bootcamp.
-- Create a table called students.
-- Add the following columns:
-- id
-- last_name
-- first_name
-- birth_date
-- The id must be auto_incremented.
-- Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
-- To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)

--Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
--Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given).
