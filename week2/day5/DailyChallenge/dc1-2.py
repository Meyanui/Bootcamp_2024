# Challenge 1 : Sorting
# Instructions
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Use List Comprehension
# Accept a comma-separated sequence of words as input

def sort_words_alphabetically():
    # Accept a comma-separated sequence of words as input
    input_sequence = input("Enter a comma-separated sequence of words: ")

    # Split the input string into a list of words and sort them alphabetically
    sorted_words = sorted([word.strip() for word in input_sequence.split(",")])

    # Join the sorted list back into a comma-separated sequence
    output_sequence = ",".join(sorted_words)
    print(output_sequence)
